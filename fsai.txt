Abstract

   This document describes a fundamental approach for handling safety
   related aspects of artificial intelligent systems.  This approach
   relies heavily on organizing information using a data structure
   which in essence, shows which is the next action intended in a given
   context.  This data structure facilitates the analysis of complex
   decisions which carry safety responsibility.  This document provides
   principles and concepts for supporting the provision of argumented
   evidences towards demonstrating the safety of an AI system.

Information Modelling using the Intention in Context

   Given a set of relevant aspects, the Context, an intelligent
   observer has the ability of determining which is the best course of
   action, the Intention.  First the observer forms the context, next
   the context is analysed, and finally, one or more courses of action
   can be deduced.  The observer can be either human, or the AI system
   under consideration (AIUC).
